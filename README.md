VideoParty
==========

**Still under development! Nothing to see here!**

But if you're really interested: When this is done, it will be a set of two applications to solve the problem of a [Youtube party][ytp] - everyone wants to show a video they like, but organizing that is annoying. The final product will consist of two parts, tentatively named player and controller.

The Player is a Mac OS X app that manages a play list of videos and plays them.

The Controller is an iOS app that logs into the playlist created by the player and adds videos to the list. It can also vote on them (that may be changed to a future version. We'll see) and remove its own ones. The idea is very much that several controllers are connected at the same time.

Of course, the player will get controller functionality as well, and it might make sense if at least the iPad version of the controller could play videos, too. We'll see.

If you're interested, great, but there is literally nothing interesting here yet, just a bunch of low-level code that isn't fully tested or implemented.
